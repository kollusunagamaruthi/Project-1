<p>Boilers require clean<strong> and soft water for longer life </strong> and better efficiency. However, the source of boiler feed water <i>there are foure</i>is generally a river or lake which may contain
    suspended <br/>and dissolved impurities, dissolved gases etc. Therefore, it is very important<mark> that water is </mark>
    first purified and softened by chemical<del>the</del> treatment and then delivered to the boiler.
    The water from<i> the source of supply is stored in storage tanks.<small> The suspended impurities</small> are
   </i> removed through sedimentation, coagulation and filtration. Dissolved gases are removed by <sub>aeration</sub>
    and degasification. The water is then<b> ‘softened’</b>> by removing temporary and permanent hardness
    through different chemical processes. The pure and soft water thus available is fed to the<sup> boiler for</sup>
    steam generation</p>
